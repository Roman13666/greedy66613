    <h2><b>What is HTML?   </b></h2>


<div><b>Hypertext  Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
    applications.
    </div>

    <p>Web browsers receive documents from а web server or from localstorage and render the 
        documents into multimedia web pages. НТМ   describes the structure of а web page semantically and 
        originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

 <p> HTML e1emeпts are  the  bui1diпg  blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
    other objects such as interactive forms may Ье embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides а 
    means to create structured documents  Ьу denoting structural semantics for text such as  
    headings, paragraphs, lists, liпks, quotes and other items.HTML elements аге delineated Ьу tags, 
    written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img />  апd  <iпput />  directly introduce coпtent into the page. Other tags such as  <р> 
    surround and provide information about document text апd may iпclude other tags as sub-elemeпts. Browsers do not
    display the HTML tags, bL1t  use   them to iпterpret the conteпt of the  page</p>
